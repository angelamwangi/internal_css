            <p>The head tag in HTML contains essential information however it is not visible.The body contains the content of the browser</p>
            <h2>It also contains headings and paragraphs.</h2>
            <p>There are 6 levels of headings, h1-h6 and <strong>not</strong> more than h6.</p>
            <p>The paragraphs are <strong>not</strong> numbered.</p>
