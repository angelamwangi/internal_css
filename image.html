            <h1>Images are like links and they require an attribute for them to function.</h1>
            <p>Images use the src attribute which is short for source.</p>
            <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
            <p>img src="Image.jpg" or, img scr="link.jpg"</p>
            <p>however it is not considered good practice to link off images to external sites.</p>
            <p>It is good to use alt attribute to describe the image eg: a very cute white cat in a bag.</p>
            <p>If it is a decorative element or logo, it doesn't need alt text but it still requires the alt attribute eg: img src="logo.jpg" alt="" </p>
