            <h1>The Joy Of Baking</h1>
            <h2>Art and Magic of Baking</h2>
            <p>The art of baking is both a science and a craft, requiring precision and creativity.</p>
            <p>The right balance of ingredients—flour, sugar, butter, and eggs—can create everything from light, fluffy cakes to crisp, golden pastries.</p>
            <p>Temperature and timing are just as crucial, as even a few minutes too long in the oven can change the texture and flavour of a bake.</p>
            <h3>Science and Comfort of Baking</h3>
            <p>Beyond the technical side, baking is also a form of expression and comfort. </p>
            <p>Many people find joy in decorating cakes or kneading dough, turning simple ingredients into something special.</p>
            <p>Whether it’s a family tradition or a new hobby, baking brings people together, filling homes with warmth and the irresistible smell of freshly baked treats.</p>
